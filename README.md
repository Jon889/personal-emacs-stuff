# Personal setup

Things I have configured on my Mac that make it easier to do things.

Show services directly in context menu instead of Services submenu:

    defaults write -g NSServicesMinimumItemCountForContextSubmenu -int 999
    
Put screenshots in a directory, not the Desktop

    defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Pictures/Screenshots
